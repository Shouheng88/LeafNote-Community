# How to delete account

The account you created in LeafNote is only used to bind your privileges. You can login to restore your purchase etc.

The password you created is encrypted by Md5, so, it's protected safely.

Anyway, you can delete the account by following ways,

- Contact the developer to delete it by sending email to shouheng2020@gmail.com
- Delete your account in App account page
